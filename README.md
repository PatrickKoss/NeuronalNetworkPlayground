# NeuronalNetworkPlayground
> A repository to show some neuronal network play arounds.

## Structure
- In the folder OpenAIGymPlayaround will be scripts for solving OpenAI gym games. [See the games from OpenAI gym here.](https://gym.openai.com/)
- In the folder Kaggle Competions will be scripts for attempting challenges from Kaggle. [You can find the challenges here.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)

## Prerequisites and Usage
> I will be using Tensorflow and Keras for building a neuronal network, so make sure you set everything right. I have trained the models with a windows machine, so in case of using a linux machine, retrain the models since you can't load the saved models.

- Install python 3.7 because that will work with Tensorflow 2.1. Python 3.8 will not work with Tensorflow 2.1.
- Install Tensorflow 2.1.
- If you want to train your models fast then install CUDA 10.1 according to this [guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-tensorflow-with-cuda-cudnn-and-gpu-support-on-windows-10-60693e46e781). Cuda uses the GPU version of Tensorflow which is significant faster.
